[Lana123] so I think, what's the point, right?

[Omar] Yeah. I keep thinking about my aunt. Have I told you about her?

[Lana123] I don't think so.

[Omar] She's super rich. Like, she drives around in a ridiculously expensive sports car, and she goes on vacations to the Bahamas

[Omar] and she has a huge house that feels more like some sort of corporate HQ than a home

[Omar]  She worked really hard to get all that, but she also screwed over a lot of people, including her own family.

[Omar] I used to be quite angry at her for what she did to my parents, but now I think… what did she get out of it?

[Omar] She and her husband are always fighting, their son became so obsessed with money that he ruined his own family…

[Omar] I mean, yeah, they have everything that I always dreamed about, but they can't enjoy any of it.

[Lana123] my grandfather was like that

[Omar] And now, at the end… what does any of it mean? If you have all the money in the world but you die alone and unloved, what did you accomplish? I don't get it. I just don't.

Hi folks,

I'm sorry to say that a few hours ago I experienced the first symptom. I'm going to work until the end of the week to make sure EL is in perfect condition, but after that I'll be going back home. I will remain reachable via email and phone for as long as possible, but I'm confident Satoko can deal with anything that comes up.

If you want to do me a huge favour, spare me the drama tomorrow, OK? I love you all but I don't have the strength for sad smiles and hugs. The best remedy for sorrow is to get the job done.

And now for something completely different! :)

Cheers,

Rob

So, hearing the call of the morning birds as they greeted the dawn, the Scribe spoke:

"At the end of your journey, when every trial has been completed, when all the gates have opened before you and your soul has been weighed in the Tower of Anubis, your Ka and your Ba shall be reunited; and thus you shall become an Akh, and awaken in the eternal reed fields of Osiris; and there, in holy Aaru, you shall begin a new life amongst the gods and other blessed spirits."

"And who will I be?" the Dying Man asked.

"You shall be the memory of all that was, and the knowledge of the journey, and the shape of the days to come."

Thus ends the tale of the Dying Man and the Scribe. Praised be Osiris, the Foremost of the Westerners, the King of Eternity, the Lord of Everlastingness,  whose Ka is holy, $&$§ DG /// ERROR ///
