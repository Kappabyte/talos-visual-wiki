The role of mutation in evolution is particularly fascinating. Mutation is essentially an error in the organism's central database: a variable gets changed, a piece of information is accidentally doubled or combined with another. Most of the time, the result is the equivalent of a bug, causing anything from minor problems to complete system shutdown (i.e. death). But sometimes the new information is functional, giving the organism an advantage against the challenges it faces, in which case it has a much higher chance of being passed to the next generation.

If you consider how unlikely a beneficial mutation is, and how long it takes for such a mutation to propagate, this process can give you an amazing insight into just how vast the genetic history of each living organism 4C494 ?(6452 OVERWRITE 0465 24 F4D204 5525 24F52 Simultaneously, it is intriguing to consider what a major role random errors have played in the evolution of life itself. The same process that has killed so many of us, often in horrific ways, is also responsible for our very existence.

Subject: EL Capacity

Yeah, no worries. EL is not only ridiculously fast, it also has a bazillion tons of space. Even while hosting a full copy of the Archive, it'll totally be able to handle all your project's data needs, assuming its output is as you suggested. I mean, the worst case scenario would be, like, centuries.

That should be enough, right?

Right? o_O

One of the common misunderstandings about evolution, sometimes accidentally promoted by people who should know better, is that it's an active process. Sometimes the term "evolve" is even applied to individual beings, as if some invisible force had driven them to suddenly change. But the truth is that individuals don't evolve; the term "evolution" describes a long-term process that can be observed in an entire population across time due to #495445524 #15449 #4F4E& example, in response to an external threat or challenge.

If an individual coincidentally has a trait that allows it to deal with that challenge more effectively than others, it is more likely to pass on that information to its descendants. That information gives them an advantage, so over time they become the dominant "model" of that species. The individuals experience no (significant) genetic change during their lifetimes, but each of them is part of the evolution of the species.
