"Tell me of the fearsome demons of the Duat," the Dying Man said to the wise Scribe.

"Though their terrible forms are loathsome to behold, they are not evil, for they are the servants of the gods; truly, they are the blessed doorkeepers and guardians of the holy paths. Their charge is to judge whether we are worthy to pass the gates that lead to Aaru; and so they challenge us with riddles, or in combat."

"Is this true of all the beings that live in the Duat?"

"Some say that it is not so; that there are ancient gods whose names have been forgotten, and spirits of darkness whose name none have ever known, and that these must be avoided at all costs. But others say that these, too, serve a greater purpose in ways that Osiris has not revealed to us."

Subject: Coming Soon: Your Son! In 3D!

Hi Mom,

I promise I'll be home soon. Maybe a couple of weeks? I know, I know… but what we're doing here is important, and the team needs my help. I’m not going to wait until it's too late, I promise, but there’s so much we have to set up, so much that has to work for a very, very long time…

Besides, I’ve always wanted to work on one of these supercomputers, and believe me, EL is pretty much the best there is. And the team, mom… it's like I'm working with rock stars and mad geniuses. Except nobody's heard of them outside of science journals, of course. But Dad would be totally geeking out if he knew!

Maybe I can tell him about it soon, huh?

Love,

Rob

What is the point of being alive? I know, I know, it's an old question and not one that's easy to answer. But I mean, if you're reading this, you are alive. And some day you will stop being alive. Both of these facts are incontrovertible.

So what about it, then? Don't you wonder? Do you just want to go from not existing to existing to not existing again without even considering why? You, right now, as you sit there reading this: why do you exist? What is the purpose of your life? Do you have one? Should you have one? Is it better to have a purpose or not? When you approach death, will you feel that your life had meaning? If so, why? If not, why not? What defines whether a life was good or not?

It may seem abstract right now, but that moment just before death will come. It is inevitable. If you don't ask yourself these questions, how will you face that moment?
