The Dying Man went unto the Scribe who resided in Pr-Medjed (1) and said: "Behold, I am weak of body; my days under the holy sun of Amun-Ra (2) are coming to an end. Though I have spent my years in service of the Two Lands, I have not studied the /?/ Tell me, you who are wise in the writings of the Dead, what lies ahead on my journey? What will I face in the Land of the Westerners? (3)"

And the Scribe spoke, saying: "At the appointed time, y$ยง&3$ยง7/%$

(1) It is likely the location was changed according to who the copy of the Book was made for; the Dying Man is an avatar of the owner.

(2) In the older manuscript, this is rendered as $%ยง%& some controversy as to whether it

(3) The dead. Compare with Khenti-Amentiu, the Foremost of the Westerners, a title later given to Osiris.

(5) Sometimes mistaken for a mistranslation on Budge's part, this is actually almost certainly a mistranslation by the ancient scribe. The equivalent portion of the older manuscript is sadly not extant.

Disgruntlomeister's Blogstasy, Episode 204

I don't know about everybody else, but I'm afraid of dying. I don't see any reason to believe there's an afterlife. I'm an organism like any other: when my brain stops working, my consciousness will cease, and I will be gone. And you know what? I can't just embrace that. I can't say I'm OK with it or I've accepted it or some nonsense like that. I don't want to have an ending. It terrifies me. If I had a genie right now, I'd wish for immortality. Who wouldn't? "Oh, but you wouldn't REALLY want to be immortal," the pseudo-philosophers say. Pretentious drivel! Everybody wants to live forever. Maybe everybody deserves to live forever, too.

But we can't, so here we are. Live with it.

Or rather, don't.
