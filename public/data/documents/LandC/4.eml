PLEASE REMEMBER TO RELEASE YOUR PETS

While it's true that not all pets will be able to adjust to living without you, many will manage, and the least you can do is give them a chance.

Just remember:

- Release your pet before you become incapacitated.

- If you notice any locked-in animals in your area, please take the time to free them.

- Leaving the doors and windows of your home open will turn it into a useful shelter.

- Setting out large quantities of dry food may help your pet through the transition period.

Drennan working as if possessed. Does she sleep?

Getting tired.

Without Contraries is no progression. Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy. Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence.
