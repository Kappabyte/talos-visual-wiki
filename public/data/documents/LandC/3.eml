Like everyone else on the internet these (last) days, I just wanted to say bye, and thanks for reading my little blog for so many years. It's been fun, hasn't it? So many deep conversations, so much philosophy… OK, OK, it was mostly cat pictures and bad puns, but still. I kinda regret spending so much time at the computer - not when I was doing stuff, just all the sitting around, checking my emails a million times, reading pointless status updates by people I didn't like… but I don't regret the friends I made here or the laughs we had.

You're all good people and I'm glad I got to know you. Have a nice end of the world.

It remains strange that the earlier generations seem to perform their toilsome labour only for the sake of the later ones; to construct for them a step from which they can raise higher the edifice that Nature intended; and only the latest of all generations have the luck to inhabit the edifice that a long line of their ancestors (unintentionally) constructed 45 56 4F 4C 55 54 49 4F 4E 20 54 48 52 4F 55 47 48 20 49 54 45 52 41 54 49 4F 4E 0D 0A 49 54 45 52 41 54 49 4F 4E 20 54 48 52 4F 55 47 48 20 50 4C 41 59 1784CE-F112] [KANT, IMMANUEL]

As puzzling as this may be, it is equally necessary, if one assumes the following: a species of animal possesses Reason, and must develop this capacity to its perfection, being individually mortal, but immortal in the species.

Ariana's Blog - Entry #477: Holy Humblebrag, Batman!

I have always known that God "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" (Matthew 5:45), but I must admit it's one thing to know the words and another to truly understand them! Though I am certain that my faith is true, that does not make me special or exempt me from suffering. I'm just another human being, and God has seen billions of us come and go. And I have to say, this is surprisingly hard to accept.

I always thought I was humble, but now I'm realizing that I was very proud of being humble, which is… really dumb. Guess I'm not the first one to do that, huh?
