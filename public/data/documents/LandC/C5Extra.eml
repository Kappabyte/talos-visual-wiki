Reader responses to last week's article on science and atheism:

"I am perfectly aware of all the arguments against religion. In fact, I agree with most of them! There is no question that there is an objective, material reality. I'm also absolutely convinced that only a secular society can be truly equal and just.

And yet, I believe. I am, as they say, a person of faith.

Religion, to me, is not about distorting observable reality with superstitions, but about *transcendence*. It's not about deluding ourselves that the Earth is 6000 years old or God will help us if we say the right words inside our heads, but about reaching out to the Sublime. This is not a rejection of reason, but its application to a set of experiences that cannot be approached by more traditional means.

True engagement with religion is humbling. It transcends culture, nationality, and gender. As such, I think it goes hand in hand with science, and is not opposed to it."

True, there are certain idealist books – not of a clerical character, but philosophical ones – wherein you can read that time and space are categories of our minds, that they result from the requirements of our thinking and that nothing actually corresponds to them in reality. But it is difficult to agree with this view. If any idealist philosopher, instead of arriving in time to catch the nine pm train, should turn up two minutes late, he would see the tail of the departing train and would be convinced by his own eyes that time and space are inseparable from material reality.

The task is to diminish this space, to overcome it, to economize time, to prolong human life, to register past time, to raise life to a higher level and enrich it. This is the reason for the struggle with space and time, at the basis of which lies the struggle to subject matter to man – matter, which constitutes the foundation not only of everything that really exists, but also of all imagination.

In his remarkable 1978 essay, "How to Build a Universe That Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later," Philip K. Dick discusses the two themes that are most central to his work: "What is reality?" and "What is an authentic human being?"

His speculations and experiences will seem extraordinary to a reader unfamiliar with his work, yet despite what may seem like far-fetched ideas - "somehow the world of the Bible is a literally real but veiled landscape, never changing, hidden from our sight, but available to us by revelation," or the notion that perhaps we all exist in the year 50 A.D. - Dick actually delivers one of the simplest, most elegant and most useful definitions of reality ever formulated:

"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."

Materialist philosophers have expressed similar ideas before (e.g. Straton of Stageira's Talos Principle), but it's particularly interesting to see such a thought expressed by a decidedly more mystical writer, wh#/&$
