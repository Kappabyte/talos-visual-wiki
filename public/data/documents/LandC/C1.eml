The Apocrypha of Saint Eadwald

This vision was granted by the Archangel Uriel to the humble servant Eadwald, that he might bear testimony of §/746865206#C=696F6E%202 620776F6 C6620 7368616C6&C2063 function(E): 65617.365/%$/

I turned to the north, and saw seven black clouds coming down upon the land. And each cloud was a plague unleashed from the Throne of God in the time of the Nephilim; in that age the plagues were buried in the Pit, there to remain until the End of Days, which was surely now come. I fell to my knees and prayed, and before me appeared seven angels, riding their chariots, wheels within wheels turning in the sky, and their light hid the clouds from my sight.

One angel stepped down onto the Earth, and by his fiery sword I knew him to be Uriel. He spoke, saying: "Seven plagues have awoken in the land, but not at the hand of Elohim; look upon the wages of sin. And shall He send forth the deluge once more, to cleanse the land of this evil? Shall He end all that slithers and all that crawls, and the birds of the sky and the fishes of the sea, to end that which you uncovered in your folly?" The $%§"&/ %//

Everything's dark and quiet. The stars are brighter than I've ever seen them. I can hear the faint sound of water high above. Inside, Alexandra is recording one of her time capsule messages while running tests on the scenario module, Arkady is uploading another batch to the Archive while muttering something about the MLA program, and Omar is sleeping on the couch we put up yesterday.

And I'm sitting here, writing this, having trouble believing that it will ever end, that this oddly peaceful existence of ours won't just go on forever. I look at Talos and EL and their purpose seems like something that's always going to be in the future, an ideal to work towards, not something that will become real.

I wonder if there will be quiet places in the simulation, places to rest without thinking about the future. I hope so. Everyone deserves some moments of peace.

Hi,

I hope you get this, the internet's been disappearing unpredictably. I want you to know that I'm going to try and get to you. I know it's far and there's not a lot of time, but I think I can manage. I want to be with you, and fra%&$%/ on the road trying to get to you seems better than just staying here, so far away from you. At least I'll be as close as I can get. Remember $§&%$&

But hey, don't be sad. I might make it. I've thought about it and the distance should be crossable on time, assuming the s&$46474 don't kick in before $§%§%.

See you soon. I love you.
