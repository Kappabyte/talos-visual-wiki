Keynote Speech by N. Sarabhai, "Questioning Doubt"

They say "doubt everything," but I disagree. Doubt is useful in small amounts, but too much of it leads to apathy and confusion. No, don't doubt everything. QUESTION everything. That's the real trick. Doubt is just a lack of certainty. If you doubt everything, you'll doubt evolution, science, faith, morality, even reality itself - and you'll end up with nothing, because doubt doesn't give anything back. But questions have answers, you see. If you question everything, you'll find that a lot of what we believe is untrue… but you might also discover that some things ARE true. You might discover what your own beliefs are. And then you'll question them again, and again, eliminating flaws, discovering lies, until you get as close to the truth as you can.

Questioning is a lifelong process. That's precisely what makes it so unlike doubt. Questioning engages with reality, interrogating all it sees. Questioning leads to a constant assault on the intellectual status quo, where doubt is far more likely to lead to resigned acceptance. After all, when the possibility of truth is doubtful (excuse the pun), why not simply play along with the most convenient lie?e #%&%§/$ 

Questioning is progress, but doubt is stagnation.

Subject: EL Partition

Hi folks,

This is just to let you know that, for reasons of convenience and security, we've partitioned EL into two separate systems. The Talos team will be working on EL-0, while the Archive team will be working on EL-1. (You might also notice an EL-2 partition, but don't worry about that, it's just the operating system doing its thing.)

Cheers,

Rob

Hey Alex,

I agree that we need something that'll keep all the modules working together, evaluate &() a final test.

And I think I have the perfect solution! It's called the Holistic Integration Manager - a fancy name for something a lot like a Dungeon Master in pen & paper RPGs. We created it to help run some MMOs back in the day. We needed something that would be able to unite procedurally-generated and user-submitted content into a coherent whole so the game wouldn't become too chaotic and inconsistent.

It's a genuine AI, somewhat limited in its ability to grow, but capable of parsing and understanding text, images, audio, even video. It takes all the information it can find, interprets it, and then builds and maintains a world based on that. It's not perfect, but we don't have a lot of time, and it would be easy to adapt the code for our purposes.

In fact, come to think of it, some of it is actually based on routines that you suggested in that paper on
