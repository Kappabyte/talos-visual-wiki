What is a man's eye but a machine for the little creature that sits behind in his brain to look through? [ARCHIVE: 1872CE-F553] [BUTLER, SAMUEL] 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 69 6E 67 20 77 6F 75 6C 64 20 61 70 70 65 61 72 20 74 6F 20 6D 61 6E 20 61 73 20 69 74 20 69 73

Is it man's eyes, or is it the big seeing-engine which has revealed to us the existence of worlds beyond worlds into infinity?  What has made man familiar with the scenery of the moon, the spots on the sun, or the geography of the planets?  He is at the mercy of the seeing-engine for these things, and is powerless unless he tacks it on to his own identity, and make it part and parcel of himself.

One of the most fascinating aspects of St. Eadwald's recently-uncovered writings is his preoccupation with finding divine truth in mathematical concepts, which at times borders on pantheism.

He was, it would seem, particularly concerned with what we now call tetrominoes, seeing in them a reflection of the tetragrammaton and the Greek word for God (TH-E-O-S). Their ability to form other shapes out of themselves symbolized to him the Creator's ability to reshape the world without breaking the laws He himself had established.

Eadwald referred to tetrominoes as "sigilla" (sigils), implying that they were a more truthful version of the magical symbols worshipped by heathens, rooted in both the Abrahamic tradition and careful observation of Creation.

It is unlikely that these texts were distributed, as they would almost certainly have resulted in charges of heresy.

I viewed, with a mixture of pity and horror, these beings training to be sold to slaughter, or be slaughtered, and fell into reflections on an old opinion of mine, that it is the preservation of the species, not of individuals, which appears to be the design of the Deity throughout the whole of Nature. Blossoms come forth only to be blighted; fish lay their spawn where it will be devoured; and what a large portion of the human race are born merely to be swept prematurely away! 156C(6966#6520 697 (3 206D6F72 6520 7468 616E 2061 2064 7265.616D: 1796CE-/$% [WOLLSTONECRAFT, MARY

Does not this waste of budding life emphatically assert that it is not men, but Man, whose preservation is so necessary to the completion of the grand plan of the universe? Children peep into existence, suffer, and die; men play like moths about a candle, and sink into the flame; war, and "the thousand ills which flesh is heir to," mow them down in shoals; whilst the more cruel prejudices of society palsy existence, introducing not less sure though slower decay.
