You know, the more I think about it, the more I believe that no-one is actually worried about AIs taking over the world or anything like that, no matter what they say. What they're really worried about is that someone might prove, once and for all, that consciousness can arise from matter. And I kind of understand why they find it so terrifying. If we can create a sentient being, where does that leave the soul? Without mystery, how can we see ourselves as anything other than machines? And if we are machines, what hope do we have that death is not the end?

What really scares people is not the artificial intelligence in the computer, but the "natural" intelligence they see in the mirror.

As one of the founders of the modern science of Noematics - many credit you with inventing the term itself - how do you see the state of the science today? Sorry I said science twice.

Nadya Sarabhai: Mixed. On the one hand, the existence of the Institute for Applied Noematics and a couple of similar organizations is highly encouraging. On the other hand, the degree to which science is seen as serving purely military or corporate causes is, in my opinion, stopping us from exploring many important avenues of research. In a sense, it's people like Alexandra Drennan who are the real pioneers today, who have the enthusiasm and dedication that the system as a whole seems to be lacking.

Do you think technology poses a danger to humanity?

Nadya Sarabhai: No. Technology is just a tool. What we do with it is up to us.

The Extended Lifespan Project. Crazy or visionary?

Nadya Sarabhai: Both!

Arkady Chernyshevsky. Crazy or visionary? :D

Nadya Sarabhai: Both! (Arkady, is that you?)

So far, all the puzzles are solvable, and completely within the necessary parameters. Alexandra had some more tweaks she wanted to suggest, but I think we're heading in the right direction here.
