Hi all,

As per the last meeting, we're going with an existing game engine for the simulation. This gives us a whole slew of advantages:

- stability

- ease of use

- modular, easy to integrate

- large amount of pre-existing assets

- inherently aimed at testing users

- designed for iterative processes

After some back and forth, we've decided to use the S65 72 69 6F 75 73 20 45 6E 67 69 6E 65 20 37 2E 35 2C 20 77 68 69 63 68 20 43 72 6F 74 65 61 6D 20 68 61 76 65 20 6B 69 6E 64 6C 79 20 6D 61 64 65 20 61 76 61 69 6C 61 62 6C 65 20 74 6F 20 75 73 2E

All the relevant documents are attached.
