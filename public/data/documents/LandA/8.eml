Subject: [NML] Talos Principle

Have you heard of the Talos Principle? It's this old philosophical concept about the impossibility of avoiding reality - no matter what you believe, if you lose your blood, you will die. I think that applies to our situation more than we'd like to admit. We could close our eyes and pretend that everything's going to be all right... but it won't change the physical reality of what's going to happen to our 4E 6F 20 6D 61 6E 20 69

I think that, as scientists, it is our duty to face the truth, and to ask ourselves the most important question: how can we help?

We are misled by considering any complicated machine as a single thing; in truth it is a city or society, each member of which was bred truly after its kind.

I'll keep this short. You all know me, so you know that I know what I'm talking about.

I realize that you're all working on projects meant to somehow avert the catastrophe we are facing. But you must all concede that there is a very real possibility that you will not have enough time to find a solution.

I believe that we *cannot* afford to ignore an extinction or near-extinction scenario. We *must* prepare for the worst. That is to say, we must seek to preserve the non-biological components of what constitutes the human species, in the hope they be recovered in the future by other (local or non-local) sentients.

I know that we are not used to thinking on that scale - not in terms of praxis - but if we truly value humanity, then we must act immediately. You'll find the details of my proposal in the attachment, but the short version is this: the creation of multiple archives (for redundancy) in safe locations that will contain, in digital form, as much information about our species (including all cultural works, scientific insights, history, DNA) as can be gathered in the given timeframe. This will be massive, global undertaking, Â§G%2/1&% with EL naturally being one of the %$
