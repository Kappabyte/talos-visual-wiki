Subject: IAN!

My first day at the Institute for Applied Noematics. On the way to work, I'm terrified. What if they don't like me? What if they're all geniuses and I'm a complete buffoon? Maybe they were just kidding about letting me work there?

Trembling, I walk in, and right at the entrance there's a life-size poster of Jeff Goldblum. What the hell?

Then I get it. Institute for Applied Noematics. IAN. Dr. Ian Malcolm from the Jurassic Park movies. Jeff Goldblum.

Dr. Sarabhai shows up, smiling. "We were trying to find a cool acronym, back when the Institute was founded," she says. "INAN? IAPN? INAPNO? It all sounded stupid, but we didn't just want to call it IAN, because, well, that's a name. Then someone made a joke about calling it JEFF, and... it kind of stuck. So we're officially called IAN, but if you hear anyone referring to JEFF, that's our... internal name, I guess. I know, I know. Bloody geeks."

After that conversation, I wasn't so scared anymore. :)

[ARCHIVE: 260BCE-F12] [STRATON OF STAGEIRA]

Whether it is true that Daedalus constructed the giant Talos, or as others say he was the creation of Hephaestus, what we may be certain of is that he was made of bronze, and had but one vein, within which flowed a liquid substance like blood, which some claim was quicksilver, and others assert was ichor such as flows in the veins of the gods. The loss of that liquid caused him to die, as a man dies when he loses his blood.

May we not then say that Talos, though created as a machine or a toy, had all the essential properties of a man? He moved of his own volition. He spoke and could be spoken to, had wishes and desires. Indeed in the tale of the Argonauts, that was the cause of his downfall. If, then, a machine may have all the properties of a man, and act as a man while driven only by the ingenious plan of its construction and the interaction of its materials according to the principles of nature, then does it not follow that man may also be seen as a machine? This contradicts all the schools of metaphysics, yet even the most faithful philosopher cannot live without his blood.
