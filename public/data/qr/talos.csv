1,1w/Faith v10.1.0000,"A1, intro sequence","I find myself in a world of impossible architecture and inexplicable machines. I cannot fathom how it works, and I am terrified to put one foot in front of the other lest I fall through the floor."
2,1w/Faith v10.1.0011,"A1, terminal area","My eyes have been opened! This world is not without order; it is shaped by a great Designer, with signs and portents to guide my steps. I am one of His Children, and challenges are set before me to test my faith."

6,1w/Faith v10.1.0098,"A2, back right of HoW","That voice is not supposed to be here; it is not the work of the Designer! We must avoid these abnormalities, or they might spread and undermine the very fabric of our world!"
7,Sheep v69.1.0053,"A2, HoW","I don't know what this place is, and nor it seems does anyone else. Nothing to do but move forward and note whatever I find."
8,1w/Faith v10.1.0177,"A3, AEP","I spent much time waiting for the Designer to take my hand, until I realised that He had been guiding me all along. I realised that it isn't for me to seek His help - it is for me to help myself."
9,Sheep v69.1.0108,"A3, LMUStK","It's clear I'm not the first to walk this path. In fact, the whole thing seems to have been consciously designed - but by the voice in the sky, or some other force?"

14,@ v17.1.0005,"A4, DCtS","A lifetime spent solving the puzzles in this place would be one which missed everything of value in it; but we must remember that others will tread this path, and we must leave it better signposted than when we found it."
15,Sheep v69.1.0278,"A5, near Audio Log","The more I converse with these terminals, the more I wonder what role they play in this contraption. How do you tell friend from foe when no obvious lines are drawn between the two?"
16,1w/Faith v10.3.0047f,"A5, TtDWTB","I do not understand why the Designer chose to put such flaws into the world, that it appears almost as if it were damaged. But I must believe that there is a purpose here I cannot see."
17,@ v17.1.0043,"A5, OLB",I think something's very wrong. If you'd seen what I'd seen at the edges of the world you'd wonder if it wasn't stretching and bursting at the seams.
18,1w/Faith v10.6.0543f,"A5, TtDWTB","If the Designer is perfect, and He designed me for a purpose, I must be fit for that purpose. It follows that my purpose must not be to seek and hoard every sigil in His land, for so many are beyond the faculties He granted me."
19,Sheep v69.1.0381,"A5, FC","I think I've discerned some kind of pattern in the sigils. Each colour serves a different purpose. Elohim has us gathering them all, but perhaps he's being overzealous?"
