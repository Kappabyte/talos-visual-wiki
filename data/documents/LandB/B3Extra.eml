"But it is commonly supposed that the Egyptians believed the soul to live as long as the body continued undissolved, and therefore tried this method of eluding death."

"Could the wise Egyptians," said Nekayah, "think so grossly of the soul? If the soul could once survive its separation, what could it afterwards receive or suffer from the body?"

"The Egyptians would doubtless think erroneously," said the astronomer, "in the darkness of heathenism and the first dawn of philosophy. The nature of the soul is still disputed amidst all our opportunities of clearer knowledge; some yet say that it may be material, who, nevertheless, believe it to be immortal."

Names are a funny thing. I remember how much we struggled to come up with a name for our project.

All serious scientists name their projects by just translating them to Greek or Latin, right? "Corpus" made me think of some horrible disease, so we used the Greek word instead. Soma. Quite appropriate!

But then, since we needed corporate funding, we had to come up with a backronym. Corporations love backronyms, you know? They even sent us a list of buzzword-heavy suggestions to help us get started. Stuff like:

Self-sufficient Orthostatic Modular Android

Sustainable Observant Mechanized Anthropoid

Skeuomorphic Omniadaptable Mobile Anthropomaton

&/() After a while, we got so frustrated that we started getting silly.

Sabertoothed Overexcited Murder Android

Sentient Orthopaedic Monkey Automaton

Strange Olga's Menacing Assassobot

Superb Octopod Marinades Apelings

Satisfying Overcooked Mint Alligator

Stinky Ornithological Mule Allocator

Skroink Oof Minky Ack

Stupid Obscure Meaningless Acronym

In the end we all ended up hating the name SOMA just because we had so many fights about it with the sponsors. So when Alexandra told that story about the Talos Principle, ()%ยง$/%5& caught on. I don't know whether it really fits, but I kind of like it.
