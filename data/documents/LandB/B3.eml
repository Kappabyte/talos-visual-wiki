The basic skeleton of the simulation is now running on EL. It's not plugged into the AI system yet, but in theory everything is ready. I guess the next step is to test whether the generated scenarios make sense? Or do we wait for the iteration module to &()

"The first wisdom," the Scribe said to the Dying Man, "is that as the world is made of five elements (1), so is the soul of Man; know therefore that in this life, you are Heart and Shadow and Name; and also Ka and Ba. Without all these, you would not be a living being, but a thing.

What is a man without a Name, who cannot speak of himself?

What is a man without a Shadow, who is not anchored in the world?

What is a man without a Heart, who can neither feel nor think?

What is a man without a Ka, who has no essence?

What is a man without a Ba, who is not himself, but like unformed clay?"

Therefore praise Osiris, the King of Eternity, the Lord of Everlastingness, the eldest son of the womb of Nut, he who traverses millions of years in his existence."

'Democrates Alter, Or, on the Just Causes for War Against the Indians' by Juan Ginés De Sepulveda

Written in 1547 to justify the Spanish conquest of the Americas.

"...the Spanish have a perfect right to rule these barbarians of the New World, who in humanity are as inferior to the Spanish as children are to adults, or women are to men, for there exists between the two as great a difference as, I might even say, between apes and men.

Compare, then, these gifts with those possessed by these half-men, in whom you will barely find the vestiges of humanity, who not only do not possess any learning at all, but are not even literate, and eat human flesh?

Therefore, if you wish to reduce them, I do not say to our domination, but to a servitude a little less harsh, it will not be difficult for them to change their masters."
