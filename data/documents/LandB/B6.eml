"But why," the Dying Man said, "do the gods put all these challenges before us? Why the walls of iron and the gates of light, why the abominable demons guarding the path? Why must our heart be judged to be as light as the feather of Ma'at? Why is the road to Aaru so difficult?"

The Scribe considered these words.

"Some say that once the paths to Aaru were open, but too many sinners came, and the gods made the paths perilous to keep sin at bay. Others say that, being mortals (3), we cannot be worthy of Aaru unless we walk the path of Osiris, and so become Osiris ourselves. But I believe that Aaru could never be reached elsewise; for like the mountain path must be steep, the path to Aaru must be fraught with peril. As steepness and mountain are one, so are peril and paradise. They are inextricable. They create each other."

&gt;This is extremely worrying! If the Link doesn't

&gt;work, the whole project will lead to nothing!

&gt;The hardware team *must* recheck everything ASAP.

Guys, guys, guys. Stop panicking. Look at your code again. In fact, look at line #217 in data_transfer.c. What are those two symbols just before the code?

//

That's right. The code that actually initiates the transfer wasn't even running. I'm guessing you were testing something yesterday and forgot to decommentify it.

The hardware isn't broken, your brains are. :)

Love,

The whole assembly stood awhile silent and collected.  "Let us return," said Rasselas, "from this scene of mortality.
