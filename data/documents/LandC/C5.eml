Subject: The LAN Party at the End of the Universe

Yo,

I don't know if you folks noticed, but it's the end of the world! There's nothing we can do about it, so instead of sitting around crying, how about we have some fun before we croak? Yes, you know exactly what I'm talking about: let's play some video games! It's LAN party time!

Two days from now, we're all getting together at the old school library. There'll be noms, drinks, music, and old-school gaming! You're invited. And bring your friends, too. Especially if they're hot.

See you in 3000 BC!

We've gotten to that irritating point where all the major stuff is in place, and all we have to deal with are a million little things.

The main modules are all functioning and interacting with each other correctly. The process is happening more or less as planned. This could actually work.

But it's still crude as hell. Some of it's just surface stuff (like the random usernames), some of it's more worrying (various bugs, the fact we haven't run more extensive tests). We've got a lot of polishing to do.

With the team down to half the original size, I'm not sure we can actually finish everything that needs to be done. So what I'd really like to discuss tomorrow morning is a new set of priorities. Please put some thought into what you think must be finished at all costs.

PS Alexandra, get some sleep. I know you're still working. This is your baby, we're going to need your input tomorrow.

Last night I had a simple but brilliant idea. Everyone who would like to write about philosophy or spirituality, especially to make some kind of grand statement about the nature of the body and the soul, should first experience a really bad tooth infection. I don't just mean a slight toothache, I mean the kind of hardcore infection that happens when several incompetent dentists miss a cavity in one of your back teeth and the thing keeps growing and growing until the nerve itself is really badly infected.

I mean, the pain is *unimaginable*. It comes in waves, and these waves drown out everything else about you. You can't talk, you can't move, you can't think, there's just pain and absolutely nothing else. It's like your brain just gets hijacked by it.

And then? You go to the dentist, and (assuming you get a decent one) they stick some chemicals in you, which make you go numb. Then they drill a hole in you, cut the nerve - snip snip - and it's over. Just like that, like repairing a car or a watch. Your whole existence was crippled by this tiny, tiny nerve sending electrochemical signals into your brain, and this unimaginable pain, which nearly blotted out your very consciousness, can be stopped just by a little cut.

We should call this the Toothy Principle, but that's incredibly stupid.
