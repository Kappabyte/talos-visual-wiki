Dear Ms. Drennan,

I heard about your project - it's the talk of the scientific community - and I'd like to make an argument for why you should abandon it.

It's not that I think your idea won't work. It very well may. But we have to look beyond purely practical questions to the issue of morality. Especially at this turning point of our spiritual ecology.

By what right can we put living beings through all that suffering, just so they can serve our purposes? Why create these pale imitations of our fatally flawed species and force them to reenact our sordid history? Why &$&//

What you are building, Ms. Drennan, is a prison - even if there is a way out. I believe you mean well, but your idea of what is valuable is rooted in the dogma of Western civilization.

We're lucky enough to be able to end our global crime spree relatively painlessly, if you consider the harm we have caused the Earth. Why not be satisfied with that and let this planet go on in peace?

I hope you heed my words, and let your "Talos" bleed out before it's too late.

Respectfully,

Chellis Jensen

Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may it not become in another hundred thousand years? Or in twenty thousand?  For man at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making machines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem to be no limits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to descend with modification from generation to generation.

It must always be remembered that man's body is what it is through having been moulded into its present shape by the chances and changes of many millions of years, but that his organisation never advanced with anything like the rapidity with which that of the machines is advancing.

Recent discussions have brought me back to an excellent 1949 article by Albert Einstein, in$%/

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;I recently discussed with an intelligent and well-disposed man the threat of another war, which in my opinion would seriously endanger the existence of mankind #5355 #5256 #4956 #414C Thereupon my visitor, very calmly and coolly, said to me: "Why are you so deeply opposed to the disappearance of the human race?"

I am sure that as little as a century ago no one would have so lightly made a statement of this kind. It is the statement of a man who has striven in vain to attain an equilibrium within himself and has more or less lost hope of succeeding. It is the expression of a painful solitude and isolation from which so many people are suffering in these days.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
