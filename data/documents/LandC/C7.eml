Team diminishing by the day. Proud of them nevertheless. Archive now incomprehensibly huge, still missing thousands of works, impossible to truly finish. Work already commenced on a sorting program to help catalogue the archive resources in our absence, but like everything else it has its foibles.

Talked to Alexandra. Talos going well. Maybe the Archive's first user will be terrestrial after all.

Estimate about a week, maybe ten days before I'm unable to keep working. A betrayal to leave early?

Excerpt: The Invention of Borders, by Fatimah Nguyen

"What today's nationalists and neosegregationists fail to understand," Kwame said, "is that the basis of every human culture is, and always has been, synthesis. No civilization is authentic, monolithic, pure; the exact opposite is true. Look at your average Western nation: its numbers Arabic, its alphabet Latin, its religion Levantine, its philosophy Greek… need I continue? And each of these examples can itself be broken down further: the Romans got their alphabet from the Greeks, who created theirs by stealing from the Phoenicians, and so on. Our myths and religions, too, are syncretic - sharing, repeating and adapting a large variety of elements to suit their needs. Even the language of our creation, the DNA itself, is impure, defined by a history of amalgamation: not only between nations, but even between different human species!"

Tasks:

1. Discuss this excerpt in the context of Wolfgang Welsch's theory of transculturality.

Now Uriel pointed his sword to the Tree of Life, which grew in the heart of dead Jerusalem.

"Behold: the tree grows still, though the city is dead. Within all that is mortal, there is the seed of immortality, for it is an immortal that fashioned it from chaos and void." Being a humble man of little wisdom, I asked: "Great Uriel, we are not allowed to eat from the Tree of Life. How may we then be saved?" And Uriel commanded me to stretch out my hand; and he gave me his fiery sword, which burned my hand, and he said: "Only by sacrifice can you free the world from the dominion of sin."

With a prayer on my lips, I fell upon Uriel's sword, and it pierced my heart. And truly, on my body, the stigmata of the Lord appeared, dripping blood that was not my blood onto the ground; and the seven heads of the dragon that were crowned in black clouds receded, and light fell upon the Earth, and Jerusalem was born again. Thus the angels departed, having delivered their message, and I awoke in the fields of our fair land, 746F2 0666F726D 207468652067 6F6C 64656 E206 1726D6F75(72206F6 620736369 656E6365
