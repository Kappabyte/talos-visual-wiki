Subject: Stray thoughts at midnight

Dearest Brother,

I admit that I am finding it very difficult to believe in a loving God under these circumstances. Why would a loving God inflict such pain and suffering on good, kind people? If truly there is a personal God... how can He be the same God who will subject those children to such unbearable pain? I remember all the answers we were taught, yet none of them seem believable now.

I don't want to stand in front of people and preach something that I don't feel in my heart. Better to have doubts than to be a hypocrite. And yet I also cannot deny the experience that led me to this vocation. So what is the truth? Perhaps it is that I neglected the mystery of God, used "He moves in mysterious ways" as an excuse rather than as the terrifying acknowledgment it truly is. Perhaps I made God too human.

If the universe has a purpose, that does not mean that it revolves around us. A sobering thought, but are we not supposed to be humble in the face of the divine?

With love,

Dear Alexandra,

As we approach the end, I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated this chance to finish my work on Soma/Talos. My faith makes death a far less frightening prospect than it is for others - I know we have all died many times before - but the thought of leaving the work unfinished did weigh on me. For having released me from that burden, I will forever be thankful to you, even if our attempt itself fails.

Though there are trillions of worlds beyond this one, I hope we may meet again in another life.

With love 54 69 6D 65 20 69 73 20 74 68 65 20 6D 65 72 63 79 20 6F 66 20 45 74 65 72 6E 69 74 79

[ARCHIVE: 1872CE-F553] [BUTLER, SAMUEL]

If all machines were to be annihilated at one moment, so that not a knife nor lever nor rag of clothing nor anything whatsoever were left to man but his bare body alone that he was born with, and if all knowledge of mechanical laws were taken from him so that he could make no more machines, and all machine-made food destroyed so that the race of man should be left as it were naked upon a desert island, we should become extinct in six weeks.

A few miserable individuals might linger, but even these in a year or two would become worse than monkeys.  Man's very soul is due to the machines; it is a machine-made thing: he thinks as he thinks, and feels as he feels, through the work that machines have wrought upon him, and their existence is quite as much a sine qu? non for his, as his for theirs.
