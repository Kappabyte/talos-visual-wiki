Subject: LOL

Ever since we moved to the new site, I feel funny. No, not in *that* way. Just... I feel like I'm about to start laughing at random. It's probably shock, right? An inability to deal with reality?

Or maybe it's just that we're working in this insane place with this insane technology on this insane project and so I feel like a genuine mad scientist. 

Stand aside, mortals! We will create LIFE! By the power of SCIENCE!

I mentioned this to Alex and she got me a pair of fake glasses. "You can't be a mad scientist without glasses," she said. "Even Ian Malcolm had glasses." And I pointed at EL and said "Life, uh, finds a way."

Maybe you had to be there.

Shall the industrious husbandman, then, plant trees the fruit of which he shall never see? And shall not the great man found laws, institutions, and a republic? What does the procreation of children imply, and our care to continue our names, and our adoptions, and our scrupulous exactness in drawing up wills, and the inscriptions on monuments, and panegyrics, but that our thoughts run on futurity?

What do you imagine that so many and such great men of our republic, who have sacrificed their lives for its good, expected? Do you believe that they thought that their names should not continue beyond their lives? None ever encountered death for their country but under a firm persuasion of immortality! Themistocles might have lived at his ease; so might Epaminondas; and, not to look abroad and among the ancients for instances, so might I myself. But, somehow or other there clings to our minds a certain presage of future ages; and this both exists most firmly, and appears most clearly, in men of the loftiest genius and greatest souls. Take away this, and who would be so mad as to spend his life amidst toils and dangers?
