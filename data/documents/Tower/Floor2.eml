To be honest, I thought that the net would be completely abandoned at this point. But internet activity has actually surged massively in the last couple of weeks! Everybody's talking. Trying to find solutions, exchanging stories, saying goodbye. It's like the entire planet is reaching out, all the disparate threads of humanity pulling together, idiots and geniuses alike, to be as human as possible one last time. It's almost like what we were always told the internet was going to be. And most of it is free now, because who cares about money at this point? Might as well have some fun.

If any of you would like to talk, especially people I've known online for a long time, send me an email. I'd love to say goodbye.

Subject: Thank you & goodbye

We sincerely hope you don't take our suicide as a sign that we were disappointed in you, unappreciative of your friendship, or in any way unhappy with our lives. Looking back, we can honestly say that we feel incredibly lucky to have known all of you and to have participated in this amazing research. And if we've contributed a little to the future of humanity, what can we feel but gratitude?

It is a true privilege to have had such insights into the nature of the mind; neither of us believes in God, but we certainly experienced a sense of awe that could be compared to a kind of religious feeling, at least according to Einstein's understanding of God. We've chosen to go now, together, because it means less suffering; one last beautiful day together seems a much better ending than a slow wasting away. In a sense, it's just mathematics.

Love,

Alan & George
